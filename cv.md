### About me:
  I am very interested in programming, create sites. I want to do this professionally. In order for my interest to turn into my profession, and thus, _combine hobbies and work_. There is a proverb: > a person who loves his work has not a single working day! Now in the process of changing the profession I devote the **maximum time to learning and training**. In general, if I set goals, I try to achieve them at all costs.
	
   I donâ€™t have much experience as such, but if you count the hours and nights  I spent at the computer, solving some interesting problems ( _for example, installing and setting up a new Linux distributiv, setting up a home network of 4 computers, creating a bash script for renaming 1000 catalogs in a working directory, and so on_ ), then it cannot be said that I do not know anything.
	
   A year ago, I got carried away with programming on Python, went on a course on STEPIK. Now I realized that **Fronted development** is more promising, and deciding to try, I realized that this area was very interesting to me. Intends to study it and become a professional.

[Kata on the codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/iamserje/completed_solutions)


And this was in Pithon:
```
# mergin 2 sorted lists
def merge(list1, list2):
    mergedList = []
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0    
    while len(list1) > ind1 and len(list2) > ind2:        
        if list1[ind1] < list2[ind2]:
            mergedList.append(list1[ind1])
            ind1+=1
        else:
            mergedList.append(list2[ind2])
            ind2+=1
        
    if len(list1) > ind1:
        resList = mergedList+list1[ind1:]
    else:
        resList = mergedList+list2[ind2:]
    return resList

# inputing data
numbers1 = [int(c) for c in input().split()]
numbers2 = [int(c) for c in input().split()]

# get function
print(merge(numbers1, numbers2))
```
